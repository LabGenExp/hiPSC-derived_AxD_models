# hiPSC-derived_AxD_models
This repository contains code used to process and analyze two scRNA-seq datasets prepared from co-culture and organoid models of Alexander disease. Samples were processed using the 10X Genomics platform. The data have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE261158.
